    -   Omit answers
    -   Display answers normally
    -   Display answers in **light gray** for semi-transparent review mode
-   ‚úÖ Clean PDF output with readable formatting
-   ‚úÖ Simple step-by-step user interface
-   ‚úÖ System pop-up with completion status and automatic app exit

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Run from Python (for developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dump-extractor.git
cd dump-extractor
```

**Dependencies:**

-   `PyPDF2`
-   `fpdf`
-   `tkinter` (built-in for most Python distributions)

Install with:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2 fpdf
```

### 2. Build Executable (.exe)

Use `pyinstaller` to build a standalone executable from `new_updated/` directory:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --add-data "C:/Windows/Fonts/malgun.ttf;." DumpExtractor.py
```

> Make sure the font path is correct for your system.

## üìÅ Output Format

The output PDF will contain:

-   Questions labeled as `NO. X`
-   Clean multiple-choice options
-   (Optional) Answer section shown in normal or light gray font
-   No explanation or extra commentary

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: What if my PDF uses `NO.` instead of `QUESTION NO:`?**  
A: It supports both automatically.

**Q: Will it work on macOS or Linux?**  
A: The app was built for Windows GUI (using the `malgun.ttf` font), but the core logic is cross-platform if adapted.

**Q: Can I batch-process multiple PDFs?**  
A: Not yet, but support for batch processing may be added in a future version.
